# ROT13
This will help you to learn rot13 (type "h") and it can convert text to rot13 and rot13 to normal text. Pretty simple

I use it to practice rot13 and I cipher my diary with rot13 :)

"`python rot13.py`"

To learn rot13 type "`h`" and press enter

To exit type "` `" (space) and click enter

Just type text to cipher or type ciphered text to decipher and ofc press enter

### But WTF is ROT13?
***

ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it, in the alphabet. ROT13 is a special case of the Caesar cipher which was developed in ancient Rome. Because there are 26 letters in the basic Latin alphabet, ROT13 is its own inverse; that is, to undo ROT13, the same algorithm is applied, so the same action can be used for encoding and decoding. The algorithm provides virtually no cryptographic security, and is often cited as a canonical example of weak encryption. ROT13 is used in online forums as a means of hiding spoilers, punchlines, puzzle solutions, and offensive materials from the casual glance. ROT13 has inspired a variety of letter and word games on-line, and is frequently mentioned in newsgroup conversations.

### How tf is this useful to me?
***

You wanna write a journal like Elliot Alderson?
Want to note your whole fuckin life down?
You don't write diary because of privacy but want to write?
Wanna cheat in school? Afraid of getting caught?

**ROT13 IS YOUR SOLUTION**

Just don't tell anyone it is rot13 or never write decipher text below ciphered text or anyone can easily decipher your "SECRET ALIEN LANGUAGE"

Well this is not a super safe way to cipher but it is easy and your can easily do it manually (enter "`h`" to learn).

IT IS BETTER THAN DOING NOTHING TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY

Your diary can reveal a lot about you. Make it harder for anyone to read it.

You can paste full article in it and then try to read ciphered one to practice ROT13 because you don't want to always depend on your devices. Also practice to do it manually or it would be very slow and also uncomfortable.
